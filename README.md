# Wii-Sports-Club-Mod-installer
PoC idea to replace Wii Sports Club's update content on storage_mlc with Python
* Usage:
`py -3 "Wii Sports Club Mod Installer.py"`
* For easy installation:
You can download install.py from this repo and run `py -3 "install.py"` to get a quick and easy setup.
* Requirements:
This requires that Commands.py from this repo is also downloaded due to it contaning all the special magic. This MUST be in the same spot as the other py file.
